Bug Report for Calendar

1) Appt.isValid(), arguments being passed to CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(year, month) are reversed.
2) Appt.isValid(), argument for month being passed to CalnedarUtil.NumDaysInMonth needs to be decremented by 1.
	Comparison to array in NumDaysInMonth throws indexoutofrange exception.
3) Appt.toString(), all strings built are null. Logic for Appt.isValid() is reversed. Needs to return null if 
	isValid() returns "not" true.
4) Appt.represntationApp(), incorrect suffix reported for each time. Logic for appending suffix "am" and "pm" is reversed.
	Changed to: (getStartHour() < 11) ? "am" : "pm".
